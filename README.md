#Vicinity Service
Vicinity Services is a location-based system that provides users with information about events available in a specific area,
while also allowing them to register for these events. This system is designed to leverage various technologies,
such as GPS and mobile networks, to deliver relevant and timely information to users based on their location. 
The primary goal of Vicinity Services is to enhance the user experience by providing access to real-time, 
location-based information that is tailored to their individual interests and preferences. 
This system is particularly useful for individuals who are unfamiliar with a particular area or who are looking for something specific in a new location.
One of the key features of Vicinity Services is its event registration capabilities.
